# ArduinoChopperDomeLighting

This is a simple dome lighting scheme for a Star Wars Rebels Chopper build. Chopper's dome is pretty sparse. There are 2 eyes, a holo projector, and a power level graph.   

This setup uses and arduino nano, 3 individual neopixels, and 2 neopixel sticks. Only 13 of the 16 LED's are actually used on the sticks as that is all the is visible in the area.

This code has the 2 eyes always set to be on and blue. The holo projector alternates between off, white, red, blue on one minute intervals. And the power cell is always lit with a low brightness and does a follow me effect.
