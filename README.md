# ArduinoChopperDomeLighting

This is a simple dome lighting scheme for a Star Wars Rebels Chopper build. Chopper's dome is pretty sparse. There are 2 eyes, a holo projector, and a power level graph.   

This setup uses and arduino nano, 3 individual neopixels, and 2 neopixel sticks. Only 13 of the 16 LED's are actually used on the sticks as that is all the is visible in the area.

* 1 arduino nano. You get 3 for ~$13: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0713XK923
* two 8 neopixel light stick for the powercell ~$11 each: https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-NeoPixel-Arduino-Integrated-Drivers/dp/B00IEDH26K
* Individual neopixels for the eyes 100 for ~$10: https://www.amazon.com/Kuman-WS2812B-Addressable-Arduino-littlergb/dp/B01M5BEO1C
